        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p> The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a classic two-player game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This version allows the player to play against the computer. The game features a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking a cell with either "X" or "O". The first player to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.</p>
