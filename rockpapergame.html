        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p> The Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is a fun and simple interactive game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a classic hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: rock, paper, or scissors. In this project, I have built a single-player version of the game where users can play against the computer.</p>
